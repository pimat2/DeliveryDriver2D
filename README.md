# DeliveryDriver2D
## Emergent Game Design Course Assignment 
This project was created as part of the Emergent Game Design Course for Hanze UAS. 
In this game the player takes the role of a delivery driver that has to deliver packages to customers. The emergent feature that I have implemented is that 
the packages and the customers that get instantiated in each level are from a list of nodes, making each playtrough and each subsequent delivery different from the 
previous one. The game has three levels. Each level has an increase in difficulty and an introduction of a new mechanic(for example in the first level the player must make 
10 deliveries to progress further, whereas in the second level he must make the samo amount of deliveries but this time there is a time limit - failing to deliver everything 
before the time ends results in a game over). Along with that in the second level the player can increase his speed by passing over speedbumps or decrease it if he hits obstacles.
The third level of the game features the mechanics from the second one along with traffic that can also hinder the speed of the player.
